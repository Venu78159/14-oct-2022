In 2007, Charan made his film debut as the leading actor in Chirutha, which was directed by Puri Jagannadh and completed 50 days in 178 direct movie theaters and 15 other shifted movie theaters.[11] He played the role of Charan, an ex-convict seeking to kill his father's murderer. Rediff.com praised his performance, stating: "Ram Charan is quite promising. Dance and action appear to be forte. He is rather graceful in the dance numbers. He also stays clear of any oblique reference to his star father by way of dialogue or adopting any particular mannerism or style."[12] His performance in the film earned him a Filmfare Best South Debutant Award and Nandi Special Jury Award.[13]

After the release of the 2009 film Magadheera, his second film, Charan established himself as one of the leading contemporary actors in Tollywood. The film, in which he played dual roles, was directed by S. S. Rajamouli, and Charan's performance was critically acclaimed.

He showcases his horse-riding and dancing skills to perfection."[14] IndiaGlitz commented: "Charan has come up with a mature performance and he has carried the film very well. Both his characters were done justice, and he reminded of his father at many places."[15] Magadheera grossed over ₹150 crores worldwide and held the record of being the highest-grossing Telugu film until 2013 before it was surpassed by Attarintiki Daredi.[16] The film received six Filmfare Awards including two awards – Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and Nandi Special Jury Award for Charan.[17]

2010–2013: Career fluctuations
Charan starred in Bommarillu Bhaskar's urban romantic film Orange in 2010 as Ram, a NRI living in Australia.[18] Although the film didn't perform well at the box office, critics praised the storyline and performance by Charan.[19] Jeevi of Idlebrain felt that Charan didn't tried to stick to stardom and is not willing to repeat the mistakes performed by stars.[20] Over the years, it became a cult film and received appreciation from the audience.[21] In her article for Film Companion, Alekhya Devarakonda compared his character to Howard Roark of 1943 novel The Fountainhead.[22] Following a year-long absence from the screen, he next appeared in Racha (2012), directed by Sampath Nandi.

The film completed a 100-day run in 38 centres across Andhra Pradesh on 13 July 2012.[23] Racha's final share for its distributors was ₹45 crore (US$5.6 million).[24] His performance in the film brought two nominations, including Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu).[25][26] Sify stated, "Both, actor Ram Charan and his director Sampath Nandi play a safe game by following the same pattern of earlier mass-masala movies."[27] Radhika Rajamani of Rediff criticized the plot of the film, but praised Charan's performance in action sequences and dance moves.[28] IndiaGlitz wrote: "He shows flashes of Chiru-ness more than he ever did in the past; be it his baritone or demeanor, he is a Megastar in effect. Helped by a strong script, he could have been much better."[29] The film was released on 5 April 2012 and was declared a commercial success.[30]


Charan with Priyanka Chopra during promotions of their film Zanjeer in 2013
Charan had two films released in 2013. His first release was Naayak, directed by V. V. Vinayak, in which he played dual role, once again after Magadheera. Writing to The Times of India, Karthik Pasupulate wrote that "Ram Charan did a great job, though there was no variation shown between the two characters."[31] It opened to mixed critical acclaim and became a commercial success.[32] The film brought him two nominations, Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu), once again, with a Best Actor award at TSR –TV9 National Film Awards.[33][34] The same year he made his Hindi cinema debut alongside Priyanka Chopra in the Telugu-Hindi bilingual film Zanjeer, a remake of the 1973 film of the same name.[35][36] He played the role of ACP Vijay Khanna who swears vengeance on his parents' killer.

The Central Board of Film Certification gave the film an 'A' certificate because of its violent action sequences.[43] Bangalore Mirror wrote that "For Ram Charan, Yevadu is essential to establish his status after Thoofan tanked at the box office. His character has two shades, and he tries his best to bring variations. He dances like there is no tomorrow and the choreography is a delight to watch."[44] A critic of Sify compared Charan's performance to his earlier films – Nayak and Thoofan and commented that he has done a fairly good job here.[45] Y. Sunita Chowdhary of The Hindu felt that Charan did well in the dance sequences than his acting in the role.[46]

As an actor, Ram Charan impresses in all the scenes that required high emotion. And as for the scenes where he had to be elevated as the hero, they will not disappoint his fans."[65] He performed his own stunts in the film.[66] Charan made a cameo appearance in "Ammadu Let's Do Kummudu" song from the film Khaidi No. 150 (2017), alongside his father Chiranjeevi, Devi Sri Prasad, and Kajal Aggarwal.[67] The film is a comeback of his father into the mainstream cinema after Shankar Dada Zindabad (2007).[68]
